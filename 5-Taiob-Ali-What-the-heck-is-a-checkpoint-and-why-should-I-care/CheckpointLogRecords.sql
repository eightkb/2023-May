Let's do a checkpoint. Notice the log records about start and end of checkpoint.
Second record LOP_XACT_CKPT	with context LCX_BOOT_PAGE_CKPT will not be there pre SQL 2012
Then run the buffer page count query again. 
Notice the change in number of dirty pages to clean pages. Pages did not get removed from buffer, only written to disk.
